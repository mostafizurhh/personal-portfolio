                I can develop a fully responsive website by using REST APIs, Firebase Authentication, JWT Authentication, Online Payment System, Vanilla CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and the most popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, and BootStrap.<br /> <br />

                I love coding because it allows me to work with different project requirements and learn new things by fulfilling project goals. I can add value to any company with my expertise, experience, and qualification. I love working in a team and am used to being a part of a multicultural work environment. <br /> <br />
