            <p>I am a Full-Stack web developer with an ambition to become a software engineer. I am energetic and cheerful with a can-do attitude, problem-solving ability, and passion for learning new things. <br /> <br />

                My coding journey started eighteen months ago while I was studying for my master's. After doing a couple of university projects, I got hooked on programming with JS and started an intensive course to learn to code professionally with Programming Hero. <br /> <br />

                Now, I can develop a fully responsive website by using REST APIs, Firebase Authentication, JWT Authentication, Online Payment System, Vanilla CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and the most popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, and BootStrap.<br /> <br />

                I love coding because it allows me to work with different project requirements and learn new things by fulfilling project goals. I can add value to any company with my expertise, experience, and qualification. I love working in a team and am used to being a part of a multicultural work environment.</p>
